# Study Plan for IBM's Entry Level Software Developer 
## DAY 1 — Core Coding & JavaScript Fundamentals
### Basics (30–45 min)
* Problem-Solving Basics 
* Focus on speed, clarity, and correctness.

**Practice:**
* [x] Reverse string
* [x] FizzBuzz (with variations)
* [ ] Find max/min in an array
* [ ] Check if a string is a palindrome

**Platforms:**
* LeetCode (Easy)
* HackerRank – Problem Solving (Basic)

### Arrays, Strings & Hash Maps (60–75 min)
* These appear in almost every IBM-style assessment.
* Using objects/maps for lookup
* Time complexity (O(n) vs O(n²))
* Edge cases (empty input, null, single item)

**Practice:**
* [ ] Two Sum
* [ ] Contains Duplicate
* [ ] Valid Anagram
* [ ] First non-repeating character
* [ ] Count character frequency in a string
* [ ] Remove duplicates from an array

**Platforms:**
* LeetCode (Easy)
* CodeSignal – Intro challenges

### JavaScript-Specific Logic (45–60 min)
**Practice:**
* [ ] Implement map, filter, reduce
* [ ] Flatten a nested array
* [ ] Deep vs shallow copy
* [ ] Closures (basic understanding)
* [ ] var vs let vs const
* [ ] Debounce or throttle (conceptual understanding is enough)

**Platforms:**
* LeetCode (JavaScript tag)
* freeCodeCamp JS Algorithms

### Git, Agile & Concept Review (30 min)
* Usually tested as MCQs or short answers.

**Review:**
* [ ] What is Git? What is a commit?
* [ ] git pull vs git fetch
* [ ] What is Agile?
* [ ] What is CI/CD?
* [ ] What is a REST API?

## DAY 2 — Backend, SQL & Mock Practice (OPTIONAL BUT STRONG BOOST)
### REST API & Backend Basics (45–60 min)
**Practice:**
* [ ] Parse JSON and extract data
* [ ] Filter/sort an array of objects
* [ ] Validate API request input
* [ ] Write a simple Express endpoint
* _Example task:_ Given a list of users, return only active users sorted by name.

**Platforms:**
* HackerRank – REST API challenges
* freeCodeCamp – APIs & Microservices

### SQL Fundamentals (45–60 min)
* Expect 1–2 SQL questions max, but they’re easy points.

**Focus:**
* SELECT with WHERE
* COUNT, GROUP BY
* ORDER BY
* INNER JOIN

**Practice:**
* [ ] Find second highest value
* [ ] Count rows by category
* [ ] Join two tables

**Platforms:**
* HackerRank – SQL (Basic)
* LeetCode – Database problems

### Mock Assessment & Review (45–60 min)
* Simulate real conditions.

**Full mock test:**
* HackerRank – Software Engineer Practice Test
* CodeSignal – General Coding Assessment
