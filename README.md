# General Exercises
A collection of coding problems that focus on algorithm and data structure practice.

## About the Project
This project is intended to provide common interview coding problems that test for optimal solutions with considerations of time and space complexity. The difficulty levels vary from easy, medium, and hard. 
* The training plan file outlines weekly problem sets that focus on algorithms and data structures.
* Markdown files named by coding problems contain the solution plan for its problem.
* Solutions are included in the script file and are implemented as functions.
